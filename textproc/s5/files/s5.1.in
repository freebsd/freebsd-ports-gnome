.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
tool eases the creation of presentation slides using the
.Dq Simple Standards-based Slide Show System .
It may be used to create a working copy of a template directory or, later,
to update the working copy after the template has changed over time.
.Pp
The
.Nm
tool supports the following command-line options:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl h
Display a short help text and exit.
.It Fl N
No-operation mode; just display the commands without executing them.
.It Fl T Ar template
Specify the template directory instead of the default
.Pa %%PREFIX%%/share/s5/s5-blank
.It Fl v
Verbose operation; display diagnostic information.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
tool supports the following actions:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm blank Ar path
Aliases:
.Cm create ,
.Cm new
.Pp
Copy the template directory into the directory specified by
.Ar path ,
creating it if necessary.
.It Cm cksum Ar path
Aliases:
.Cm check ,
.Cm verify
.Pp
Verify the checksums recorded for the S5 presentation files in
the directory specified by
.Ar path .
The
.Nm
utility reports both files that have been modified (fail the checksum
check) and files that no longer exist yet have checksums recorded.
.It Cm help
Alias:
.Cm usage
.Pp
Display a short help message and exit.
.It Cm mksum Ar path
Record the template checksums into a file in a directory specified by
.Ar path .
Users should never really have to execute this by hand, since it is
done internally as part of the
.Cm blank
and
.Cm update
command processing.
.It Cm update Ar path
Update the S5 presentation files in the directory specified by
.Ar path
with the new versions in the S5 template directory.
.Pp
Before updating, the
.Nm
utility verifies the checksums of the files in the
.Pa path
directory, and terminates if a mismatch is found.
After that,
.Nm
checks for any files that exist in both the new template and in the
.Ar path
directory, but are not recorded in the checksum file (i.e. have been
placed in
.Ar path
by hand after the last
.Nm Cm blank
or
.Nm Cm update
run) and terminates if any such files differ.
.Pp
If all these checks are successful, the
.Nm
utility copies the template files over those in
.Ar path ,
overwriting any existing files and retaining any files that do not
exist in the template directory.
.El
.Sh FILES
.\" FIXME: describe any configuration files when they show up
The
.Nm
utility stores the checksums of blank S5 presentations into a file named
.Pa s5-checksums.txt
into the presentation directory.
This is a simple text file with lines containing of a keyword and values.
The keywords that the
.Nm
utility currently generates and parses are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm CKSUM_CMD Ar checksum-program
The name of the checksum program to use; the default is
.Xr cksum 1 .
.It Cm CKSUM_ARGS Op Ar [argument...]
The arguments (if any) passed to the checksum program as defined by the
.Cm CKSUM_CMD
line.
The default is an empty string, no arguments passed.
.It Cm FILE Ar filename
The name of the file that the following
.Cm CKSUM
line refers to.
.It Cm CKSUM Ar checksum-line-text
The output of the checksum command as specified by
.Cm CKSUM_CMD
and
.Cm CKSUM_ARGS
conflated into a single line.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Start a brand new presentation:
.Pp
.Dl s5 blank ~/txt/openfest/2006/gnupg
.Pp
Verify if any of the S5 files in the presentation have been modified:
.Pp
.Dl s5 cksum gnupg/
.Pp
Do the same, but display verbose information about the lines read from
the checksums file and the files verified:
.Pp
.Dl s5 -v cksum gnupg/
.Pp
Update the S5 presentation files after installing a new system-wide
version of the S5 template:
.Pp
.Dl s5 update gnupg/
.Pp
Store the checksums of the S5 template files
.Em ( not
the real files in the presentation directory!) into the
.Pa s5-checksums.txt
file in the
.Pa gnupg/
directory; this is actually redundant, as it is done as part of the
.Nm Cm blank
invocation:
.Pp
.Dl s5 mksum gnupg/
