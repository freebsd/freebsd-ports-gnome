Bomstrip is a very simple tool that removes BOM's (byte-order-marks)
from utf-8 files. Actually, it is a set of tools that all do the same
thing, but - for added entertainment value - in multiple programming
languages (python, c, java, brainfuck, ook!, perl, sed, postscript,
pascal, unlambda, limbo, haskell, ocaml, php, ruby). You want to always
have this tool within hand-reach, no matter where you are and which
compilers/interpreters you keep close to you.

Each tool reads from stdin and writes to stdout. It accepts no options
or arguments. It never writes into files directly. All files are public
domain. It exists for the purpose of noting how stupid BOM's in utf-8
files are.

Oh, in case you didn't know yet: utf-8 does not have byte-ordering
issues, so there is absolutely no need to have three bytes (the
utf-8-BOM) that do not say anything about the byte-order (since there
is nothing to say).
