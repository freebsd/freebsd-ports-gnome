PDFMiner.six is a fork of PDFMiner using six for Python 2 + 3 compatibility.

PDFMiner is a tool for extracting information from PDF documents. Unlike other
PDF-related tools, it focuses entirely on getting and analyzing text data.

PDFMiner allows one to obtain the exact location of text in a page, as well as
other information such as fonts or lines. It includes a PDF converter that can
transform PDF files into other text formats (such as HTML). It has an extensible
PDF parser that can be used for other purposes than text analysis.

Features:

- Parse, analyze, and convert PDF documents.
- PDF-1.7 specification support. (well, almost)
- CJK languages and vertical writing scripts support.
- Various font types (Type1, TrueType, Type3, and CID) support.
- Basic encryption (RC4) support.
- Outline (TOC) extraction.
- Tagged contents extraction.
- Automatic layout analysis.
