First start the zerotier service:

service zerotier start

To connect to a zerotier network:

zerotier-cli join <network>

If you are running other daemons or require firewall rules to depend on
zerotier interfaces being available at startup, you may need to enable
the following sysctl in /etc/sysctl.conf:

net.link.tap.up_on_open=1

This avoids a race condition where zerotier interfaces are created, but
not up, prior to firewalls and services trying to use them.
