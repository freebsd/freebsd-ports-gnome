GeoIP is a C library that enables the user to find the country that any
IP address or hostname originates from. This library supports the legacy
GeoIP database. Although it is kept up-to-date, the non-legacy database
(net/libmaxminddb) is preferable when supported.

This module can be used to automatically select the geographically closest
mirror, to analyze your web server logs to determine the countries of your
visitors, for credit card fraud detection, and for software export controls.

This port includes a helper script, geoipupdate.sh, to help you keep the
library up-to-date. The helper script will only update the legacy
database. To update GeoIP2 databases, install the geoipupdate port from
net/geoipupdate.
