Mininet creates a realistic virtual network, running real kernel, switch
and application code, on a single machine (VM, cloud or native), in
seconds, with a single command.

Because you can easily interact with your network using the Mininet CLI
(and API), customize it, share it with others, or deploy it on real
hardware, Mininet is useful for development, teaching, and research.
