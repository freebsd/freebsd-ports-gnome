 UPGRADING 
===========

As always it is strongly encouraged to make a backup of the database before the
database migrations will be executed.

The following steps are required to finish the upgrade: 

1. Run database migrations and collect static files:

# cd %%DATADIR%%
# python%%PYTHON_VER%% manage.py migrate
# python%%PYTHON_VER%% manage.py collectstatic --no-input

2. Restart WSGI/httpd environment (supervisord/apache/nginx/etc.)
