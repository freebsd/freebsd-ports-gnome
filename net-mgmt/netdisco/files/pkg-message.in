Welcome to netdisco 2 !

to get it running, you just have to:
 * edit %%ETCDIR%%/environments/deployment.yml to suit your needs
   (perldoc App::Netdisco::Manual::Configuration)
 * edit rc.conf according to %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/netdisco
 * read "perldoc App::Netdisco::Manual::Deployment"
 * launch netdisco-deploy *as user netdisco* to install/upgrade your database
 * copy (or link) %%ETCDIR%%/netdiscologs.conf
   to %%PREFIX%%/etc/newsyslog.conf.d/ to take care
   of logs rotation

Always use "su - netdisco" before running netdisco-do or netdisco-deploy
 (because of locallib use)
