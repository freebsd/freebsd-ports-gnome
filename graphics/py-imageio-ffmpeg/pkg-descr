The purpose of this project is to provide a simple and reliable ffmpeg wrapper
for working with video files. It takes care of producing platform-specific
wheels that include the binary executables of ffmpeg. These can then be
installed (and updated or uninstalled) easily with pip.

It also provides simple generator functions for reading and writing data from/to
ffmpeg, which reliably terminate the ffmpeg process when done.

This library is used as the basis for the imageio ffmpeg plugin, but it can also
be used by itself. Imageio provides a friendlier (higher level) API, and adds
support for e.g. cameras and seeking.
