Sverchok is a parametric tool for architects and designers. You can use it to
program objects' shapes without knowing any programming languages.

It is an add-on for Blender.

Sverchok IS a parametric tool that relies on easy-to-use visual node-based
design to create low-level data structures.

Sverchok IS NOT an all-in-one tool. It does not have lighting and the rest
of Blender's toolbox.

It implements the approach of MATH + MESH + SPLINES + NURBS. It lets you operate
with digits and math with high level language to manipulate nodes visually.

Sverchok has been inspired by Grasshopper from Rhino 3D and uses a similar
node-based visual programming principle. We are trying to bring this feature set
to Blender users.
