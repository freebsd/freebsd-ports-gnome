Terms and Conditions of Use ("TCU")

 - GIMPS participation is free of charge and open to the public
   internationally.
 - Web Site. The GIMPS "Web Site" is understood to include all
   Mersenne.org Internet web site domains, web content and services,
   PrimeNet APIs, data, downloads, etc., regardless of means of access.
 - Non-Participants. Viewing the Web Site does not necessarily make you
   a Participant; non-Participants are not bound by this TCU.
 - Participation Constitutes Agreement. "Participant" is understood to
   be an individual person, or a single individual person designated as
   the authorized representative of any group, team, organization or
   legal entity, who personally, or whose computer(s), accesses and/or
   communicates with the Web Site to perform, or cause to perform,
   mathematical calculations that are, or typically, systematically
   organized by GIMPS. This includes, but is not restricted to, use of
   Prime95, MPrime, GLucas, or similar software, automatically over the
   Internet or using the Web Site (manual testing forms, reports, APIs,
   etc.), to get data or work assignments or to upload results or other
   data. Participation constitutes agreement with the TCU by that
   individual and any group, team, organization or legal entity the
   Participant represents.
 - Participant Identifiers. Participant's user ID, password and email
   address are the primary unique identifiers used by GIMPS to
   communicate and confirm Participant's identity. Secondary
   identifiers may include unique computer identifiers known as a
   "GUID". The "Anonymous" or "ANONYMOUS" user ID is owned by GIMPS,
   but may be used by Participants who do not wish to be publically
   identified.
 - Award Rules. Participant agrees to the Research Discovery Award Rules.
 - Award Refusal. Participant may at their option decline any award.
   Research Discovery Award Rules apply even if an award is unclaimed
   or optionally declined by the Participant.

   publish or make available certain limited subset(s) of that data for
   public reference, excluding personally identifiable data according
   to the Privacy Policy. Examples of published data are stats,
   standings, charts and other derived charts or tables.
 - Disclaimer. GIMPS is not responsible for any losses due to Web Site
   errors, electronic transmission errors, omissions or unauthorized
   disclosures, failure of any software to correctly find and timely
   report a new prime number, or any other research discovery, or for
   someone "poaching" or "stealing" your assignment (performing work on
   it without it being assigned to them by GIMPS) and subsequently
   making a discovery.
 - Terms and Conditions of Use Changes. GIMPS reserves the right to
   change this TCU without notice. Last updated 15 October 2008.
 - Jurisdiction. Jurisdiction of law shall be the State of California
   and the United States of America. Participant agrees to settle all
   disputes through a good faith effort directly with GIMPS officers
   and directors, or as a last resort, by third-party binding
   arbitration through a certified arbitrator of GIMPS' choosing.


Research Discovery Award Rules ("Rules")
1) General Award Rules

 - Participants. "Participant" is understood as defined in the Terms
   and Conditions of Use ("TCU").
 - Award Eligibility. All GIMPS Participants are automatically eligible
   for Research Discovery Awards. GIMPS-interested parties, including
   its officers, directors, their immediate family members or
   directly-contracted agents, are ineligible for any award.
 - Awardees. "Awardee" is understood to be the Participant, or the
   group, team, organization or legal entity the Participant represents,
   and whose computer achieves a research discovery for which an award
   exists and all Rules in effect at the time of the discovery comply.
 - Award Payee. Awards are payable to a single Awardee, except if the
   Awardee designates a single charity to receive all or part of the
   award, for which GIMPS will make reasonable effort but does not
   guarantee to accommodate. Awardee is responsible for all applicable
   taxes and fees.
 - Awardee Information. Certain information about the Awardee, and where
   designated information about a selected charity, may be collected by
   GIMPS where lawfully required.
 - Discovery Evidence. As proof of discovery, Participant agrees to
   email to GIMPS at woltman@alum.mit.edu and/or primenet@mersenne.org
   certain data files generated by any software program used to make the
   discovery, along with their name, post mailing address, phone number,
   and GIMPS user ID if not anonymous. If proof is not satisfactory, it
   will be treated as an unclaimed award.
 - Discovery Non-Disclosure Period. Participants and Awardees agree to a
   reasonable immediate period of non-disclosure communications silence,
   not to exceed 90 days, about any discovery, alleged or verified,
   until GIMPS announces the discovery to the academia and press.
   Non-compliance may result in award disqualification.
 - Evidence of Authority. A Participant who does not own a computer on
   which a research discovery is found must produce written evidence
   satisfactory to the GIMPS board of directors of their status as a
   designated authorized representative with authority over that
   computer and to bind the TCU, before they, or whom they represent,
   can be considered an Awardee. If proof is not satisfactory, it will
   be treated as an unclaimed prize.
 - Award Notification. Participant is responsible for maintaining and
   monitoring the email address registered in their GIMPS user ID
   account. GIMPS is not responsible for ensuring email notification
   delivery or receipt by Participants. Anonymous Participants will not
   be notified. It is not necessary to receive an email notification
   from GIMPS to qualify for a Research Discovery Award.
 - Award Claims and Release Waivers. Participant and Awardee is/are
   responsible for claiming any applicable Research Discovery Award, and
   agree to execute a GIMPS award claim and release waiver and/or
   release waiver, as appropriate, satisfactory to the GIMPS board of
   directors.
 - Unclaimed, Expired, Disqualified and Refused Awards. Unclaimed awards
   expire one year from the date of the qualifying discovery. Expired,
   refused or disqualified awards will be donated by GIMPS to a
   501(c)(3) charity or retained by GIMPS to fund awards or cover its
   expenses.
 - Other Disqualifications. GIMPS reserves the right to deny award
   payment if the Awardee is determined by the GIMPS board of directors
   to be personally, or affiliated with, or organized under, a charter
   or entity, practicing or promoting interests counter to humanitarian
   good or public benefit. GIMPS may require Awardee to execute an
   affidavit of eligibility according to these Rules.
 - Assignment of Specific Interest. Whereas GIMPS has undertaken an
   organized and systematic attempt to earn the $150,000 (USD)
   Electronic Frontier Foundation ("EFF") Cooperative Computing Award,
   all Participants and Awardees agree to the Rules and release their
   entire interest in the EFF award to GIMPS (see Research Discovery
   Awards).
 - Final Authority. Decisions of the GIMPS board of directors in
   applying the TCU and Rules, and in granting awards, are final.
 - Rule Changes. These Rules, as in effect at the date and time of a
   discovery, shall apply. GIMPS reserves the right to change these
   Rules without notice. Last updated 06 January 2010.

2) Research Discovery Awards

Mersenne Prime Award of USD $3,000.00
Awarded to a GIMPS Participant for each new Mersenne prime discovered
after August 23, 2008 and having fewer than 100,000,000 (decimal) digits.
Rules in addition to the General Award Rules:

 - The award is presently $3,000. A maximum of $5,000 USD and minimum
   of $1,000 will be awarded, as determined by the GIMPS board of
   directors from actual and forecast award funds availability.
   GIMPS may, at its sole discretion and without notice, change the
   award amount or retroactively increase certain previously-awarded
   Research Discovery Awards up to the maximum amount.
 - Verification may take several weeks. No money will be awarded until
   the discovery is independently verified, and the award money is
   available after GIMPS annual operating expenses.
 - In the unlikely event that an identical qualifying prime is
   discovered at about the same time by two or more Participants, then
   the winner will be the first to either send their result to the
   GIMPS PrimeNet server or to email their results to GIMPS.

100 Million Digit Prime Award of USD $50,000.00
Awarded to a GIMPS Participant for the first prime discovered having at
least 100,000,000 (decimal) digits. Rules in addition to the General
Award Rules:

 - GIMPS has undertaken an organized and systematic attempt to earn the
   $150,000 (USD) Electronic Frontier Foundation ("EFF") Cooperative
   Computing Award such that each Participant assigns all interest in
   this award entirely to GIMPS. Note that this Award may at current
   participation rates require an estimated 12-15 years of calculations
   before a qualifying discovery is made.
 - No money will be awarded unless and until a GIMPS Participant's
   computer discovers a 100,000,000 digit prime, it is independently
   verified, EFF validates GIMPS' claim according to their rules, and
   pays GIMPS the award.
 - Verification may take several weeks and publication in a suitable
   academic refereed journal as required by EFF rules will likely take
   several more months.
 - GIMPS will redistribute the EFF award money into thirds as follows:
 -- $50,000 will be awarded to the discoverer Awardee of the
    100,000,000 digit prime.
 -- $50,000 will be awarded to a 501(c)(3) mathematics-related charity
    selected by GIMPS.
 -- $50,000 will be retained by GIMPS to cover expenses and/or fund
    future or past awards.
 - In the unlikely event that more than one qualifying prime is
   discovered at about the same time, then the winner will be the first
   to either send their result to the GIMPS PrimeNet server or to email
   their results to GIMPS.
