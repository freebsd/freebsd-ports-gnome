SymCXX is an experimental Python package (with its core implemented in C++)
for symbolic manipulation with limited scope (as in minimal). It tries to stay
compatible with the API of SymPy. Its main goal is to explore designs related
to automatic differentiation and numerical evaluation similar to SymEngine's
Lambdify functionality.
