py-django-common-helpers consists of the following things:

- Middleware that makes sure a web-app runs either on or without "www" in the
  domain.

- "SessionManagerBase" base class, that helps in keeping session related code
  object-oriented and clean.

- "EmailBackend" for authenticating users based on their email, apart from
  username.

- Custom db fields that can be used in models including a "UniqueHashField"
  and "RandomHashField".

- Bunch of helpful functions in helper.py

- "render_form_field" template tag that makes rendering form fields easy
  and DRY.

- Couple of dry response classes: "JsonResponse" and "XMLResponse" in the
  django_common.http that can be used in views that give json/xml responses.
