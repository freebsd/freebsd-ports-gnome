--I--
For correct operation, shared memory support has to be enabled
in Iridium by performing the following command as root :

	# sysctl kern.ipc.shm_allow_removed=1

To preserve this setting across reboots, append the following
to /etc/sysctl.conf :

	kern.ipc.shm_allow_removed=1

FreeBSD 11.0-RELEASE and newer have this set by default.

--II--
Iridium has a known problem of hanging tabs. The bug has been fixed
in r337328. Therefore, it is recommended to upgrade the system after
the correction date.

	# svn diff -c337328 --summarize svn://svn.freebsd.org/base
