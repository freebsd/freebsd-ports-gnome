CGI::Simple provides a relatively lightweight drop in replacement
for CGI.pm. It shares an identical OO interface to CGI.pm for
parameter parsing, file upload, cookie handling and header generation.
This module is entirely object oriented, however a complete functional
interface is available by using the CGI::Simple::Standard module.
