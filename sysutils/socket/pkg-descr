The program Socket implements access to TCP sockets from shell level.
First written for the need to open a server socket and read and write
to the socket interactively for testing purposes, it quickly evolved
into a generic tool providing the socket interface for shell script
and interactive use.

Please send any comments, suggestions, bug reports etc. to me:
