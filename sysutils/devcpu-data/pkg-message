Installing this port will allow host startup to update the CPU microcode on 
a FreeBSD system automatically.  In order to enable this feature, add the
following to the system's /etc/rc.conf:

microcode_update_enable="YES"

To ensure the update is applied, reboot the system or start the microcode update
service via:

# service microcode_update start

If the CPU requires a microcode update, a console message such as the following
will appear:
