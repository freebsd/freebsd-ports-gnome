Afio makes cpio-format archives. It deals fairly gracefully
with potential input data corruption. Supports multi-volume
archives  during  interactive  operation.  Afio  can  make
compressed archives that are much safer than compressed tar,
or cpio archives. Afio has a tremendous number of options.
Afio might be best used as an `archive engine' in a backup
script.
