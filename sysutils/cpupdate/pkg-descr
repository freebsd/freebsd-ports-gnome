x86 CPU microcode utility for BSD.

As of March 2018, it is still work in progress
but should do its job for most cases already.

Note: update FreeBSD to version level 1101507 for 11.x or 1200055 for 12.0
before building/using this utility if your microcode update brings
new CPU features like Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (IBRS).
