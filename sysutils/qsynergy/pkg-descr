QSynergy is a comprehensive and easy to use graphical front end for
Synergy. Synergy lets a user control more than one computer with
a single mouse and keyboard (and has lots and lots of extra features
on top of that). Synergy itself only comes with a GUI for MS
Windows. QSynergy was written to fill the gap for users on Mac and
Unix platforms. Of course, it runs on MS Windows as well.
