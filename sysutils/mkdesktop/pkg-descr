Installing a FreeBSD desktop from scratch can be messy: you often
forget the correct steps/packages. The mkdesktop script helps to
standardize the process, with plenty of flexibility as well as
modularity. The script :

Configures X and your desktop;
Configures emulation layers (Wine / Linuxulator);
Configures essential system files under /etc and /boot;
Configures the SLiM login manager.
