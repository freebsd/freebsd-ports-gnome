distro (for: Linux Distribution) provides information about the Linux
distribution it runs on, such as a reliable machine-readable ID, or version
information.

It is a renewed alternative implementation for Python's original
platform.linux_distribution function, but it also provides much more
functionality which isn't necessarily Python bound like a command-line
interface.
