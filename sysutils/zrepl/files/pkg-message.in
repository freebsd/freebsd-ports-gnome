zrepl must be configured before it is started the first time.
- Create the log file /var/log/zrepl.log:
  # service newsyslog restart
- Teach syslogd to redirect facility local0 to the zrepl.log file:
  # service syslogd reload
- Modify the %%PREFIX%%/etc/zrepl/zrepl.yml configuration file
- For remote backups, create the SSH key pair and authorized_keys file
- Enable the zrepl daemon to start automatically at boot:
  # sysrc zrepl_enable="YES"
- Start the zrepl daemon:
  # service zrepl start

*** BREAKING CHANGES WITH THE 0.0.3 RELEASE: ***
- Snapshots are automatically bookmarked and pruning of bookmarks must
  be configured by adding the keep_bookmarks parameter to the prune
  policy section of the zrepl configuration file (source side only).
  Be sure to understand the meaning bookmarks have for maximum
  allowable replication downtime.
- The ssh+stdinserver transport protocol has changed, requiring zrepl
  to be updates on both the sending and receiving side, and the daemon
  restarted on both sides.
- The first outlet in the global.logging section of the configuration
  file is now used for logging meta-errors (e.g. problems encountered
  when writing to other logging outlets).
