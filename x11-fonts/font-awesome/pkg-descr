Font Awesome is a suite of pictographic icons for easy scalable vector
graphics, created and maintained by Dave Gandy.

This package installs only free TTF and OTF fonts suitable for use in X.Org
applications.  The corresponding web fonts aren't installed.  You can find
them installed by a lot of other ports.
