This package contains the set of ukrainian fonts for X11 Release 6.
Copyright (C) 1995 Victor Forsyuk <victor@gu.net>

This set is based on so-called "Cronyx" font set, that was copyrighted
by Cronyx Ltd.: Copyright (C) 1994-1995 Cronyx Ltd.

Under no circumstances is the author responsible for the proper
functioning of this software, nor does the author assume any
responsibility for damages incurred with its use.

This port also creates  two aliases for each of the  fonts -- for koi8-r
encoding (koi8-u is a superset of koi8-r anyway) and for cronyx foundry.
Some applications (gtk?) look for -cronyx-*- and/or *-koi8-r explicitly,
but there is no reason why this fonts cannot be used in those cases.
