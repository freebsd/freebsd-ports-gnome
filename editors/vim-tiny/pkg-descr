Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text editing.
It is an improved version of the vi editor distributed with most UNIX systems.

Vim is often called a "programmer's editor," and so useful for programming that
many consider it an entire IDE. It's not just for programmers, though. Vim is
perfect for all kinds of text editing, from composing email to editing
configuration files.

This is the "tiny" version, which is console-only and contains ONLY the vim
binary. It contains no help files, syntax files, or any other runtime files,
and is designed only for minimal installs. You almost always want the vim
or vim-console package instead.
