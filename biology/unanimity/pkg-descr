Unanimity is a C++ library + applications to generate and process accurate
consensus sequences from Pacific Biosciences sequence data.

The core binary, CCS (circular consensus calling) takes multiple reads of the
same SMRTbell sequence and combines them, employing a statistical model, to
produce one high quality consensus sequence.
