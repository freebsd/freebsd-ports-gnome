Version 2 of dnscrypt-proxy is written in Go and therefore isn't capable
of dropping privileges after binding to a low port on FreeBSD.

By default, the dnscrypt-proxy2 port will listen on (tcp/udp) port 5353
as the _dnscrypt-proxy user.

It's possible to change back to port 53, but not recommended.

Below are a few examples on how to redirect local connections from port
5353 to 53.

[ipfw]

  ipfw nat 1 config if lo0 reset same_ports \
    redirect_port tcp 127.0.0.1:5353 53 \
    redirect_port udp 127.0.0.1:5353 53
  ipfw add nat 1 ip from any to 127.0.0.1 via lo0

  /etc/rc.conf:
    firewall_nat_enable="YES"

  /etc/sysctl.conf:
    net.inet.ip.fw.one_pass=0

[pf]

  rdr pass on lo0 proto { tcp udp } from any to port 53 -> 127.0.0.1 port 5353

[unbound]

  server:
    interface: 127.0.0.1
    do-not-query-localhost: no

  forward-zone:
    name: "."
    forward-addr: 127.0.0.1@5353
