+IMAP FILTER Sieve plugin for Pigeonhole
+
+Relevant specifications
+=======================
+
+	doc/rfc/draft-bosch-imap-filter-sieve-00.txt
+
+Introduction
+============
+
+Normally, Sieve filters can either be applied at initial mail delivery or
+triggered by certain events in the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAPSIEVE;
+RFC 6785). The user can configure which Sieve scripts to run at these instances,
+but it is not possible to trigger the execution of Sieve scripts manually.
+However, this could be very useful; e.g, to test new Sieve rules and to
+re-filter messages that were erroneously handled by an earlier version of the
+Sieve scripts involved.
+
+Pigeonhole provides the imap_filter_sieve plugin, which provides a vendor-
+defined IMAP extension called "FILTER=SIEVE". This adds a new "FILTER" command
+that allows applying a mail filter (a Sieve script) on a set of messages that
+match the specified searching criteria.
+
+This plugin is experimental and the specification is likely to change.
+
+Configuration
+=============
+
+The IMAP FILTER Sieve plugin is activated by adding it to the mail_plugins
+setting for  the imap protocol:
+
+protocol imap {
+	mail_plugins = $mail_plugins imap_filter_sieve
+}
+
+Currently, no other settings specific to this plugin are defined. It uses the
+normal configuration settings used by the LDA Sieve plugin at delivery.
+
+The sieve_before and sieve_after scripts are currently ignored by this plugin.
+
+Example
+-------
+
+protocol imap {
+  # Space separated list of plugins to load (default is global mail_plugins).
+  mail_plugins = $mail_plugins imap_filter_sieve
+}
+
+plugin {
+  sieve_global = /usr/lib/dovecot/sieve-global.d
+}
+
