Net::SMTP::SSL implements the same API as Net::SMTP, but uses IO::Socket::SSL
for its network operations. Due to the nature of Net::SMTP's new method, it is
not overridden to make use of a default port for the SMTPS service. Perhaps
future versions will be smart like that. Port 465 is usually what you want, and
it's not a pain to specify that.
