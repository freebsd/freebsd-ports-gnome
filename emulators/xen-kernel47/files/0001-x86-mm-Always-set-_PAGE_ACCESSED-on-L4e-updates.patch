+ * purposes), we cannot efficiently sync access bit updates from hardware

+ *
+ * We therefore unconditionally set _PAGE_ACCESSED even in the guests
+ * view.  This will appear to the guest as a CPU which proactively pulls
+ * all valid L4e's into its TLB, which is compatible with the x86 ABI.
+ *
+ * At the time of writing, all PV guests set the access bit anyway, so
