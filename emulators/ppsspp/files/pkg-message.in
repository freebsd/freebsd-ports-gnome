Known issues:
- %%DATADIR%%/assets/gamecontrollerdb.txt cannot be used
  as is because SDL_JoystickGetGUID is a stub on FreeBSD. Create the
  file using controllermap (or antimicro) then check with testgamecontroller
  it's detected (pay attention to guid). If you have trouble making it
  work try OLDJOY option for v1.3 behavior.
- Vulkan support may not work on Intel iGPUs due to
  https://github.com/FreeBSDDesktop/DEPRECATED-freebsd-base-graphics/issues/132
  which can be worked around by running PPSSPP as root (via sudo, doas, etc.)
  after applying https://bz-attachments.freebsd.org/attachment.cgi?id=187401
