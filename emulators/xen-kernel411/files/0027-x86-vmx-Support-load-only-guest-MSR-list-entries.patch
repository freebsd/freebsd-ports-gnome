Subject: [PATCH 27/42] x86/vmx: Support load-only guest MSR list entries
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Currently, the VMX_MSR_GUEST type maintains completely symmetric guest load
and save lists, by pointing VM_EXIT_MSR_STORE_ADDR and VM_ENTRY_MSR_LOAD_ADDR
at the same page, and setting VM_EXIT_MSR_STORE_COUNT and
VM_ENTRY_MSR_LOAD_COUNT to the same value.

However, for MSRs which we won't let the guest have direct access to, having
hardware save the current value on VMExit is unnecessary overhead.

To avoid this overhead, we must make the load and save lists asymmetric.  By
making the entry load count greater than the exit store count, we can maintain
two adjacent lists of MSRs, the first of which is saved and restored, and the
second of which is only restored on VMEntry.

For simplicity:
 * Both adjacent lists are still sorted by MSR index.
 * It undefined behaviour to insert the same MSR into both lists.
 * The total size of both lists is still limited at 256 entries (one 4k page).

Split the current msr_count field into msr_{load,save}_count, and introduce a
new VMX_MSR_GUEST_LOADONLY type, and update vmx_{add,find}_msr() to calculate
which sublist to search, based on type.  VMX_MSR_HOST has no logical sublist,
whereas VMX_MSR_GUEST has a sublist between 0 and the save count, while
VMX_MSR_GUEST_LOADONLY has a sublist between the save count and the load
count.

One subtle point is that inserting an MSR into the load-save list involves
moving the entire load-only list, and updating both counts.
