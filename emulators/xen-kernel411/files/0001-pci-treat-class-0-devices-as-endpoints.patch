Subject: [PATCH] pci: treat class 0 devices as endpoints
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Class 0 devices are legacy pre PCI 2.0 devices that didn't have a
class code. Treat them as endpoints, so that they can be handled by
the IOMMU and properly passed-through to the hardware domain.

Such device has been seen on a Super Micro server, lspci -vv reports:

00:13.0 Non-VGA unclassified device: Intel Corporation Device a135 (rev 31)
	Subsystem: Super Micro Computer Inc Device 0931
	Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0, IRQ 11
	Memory at df222000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=4K]
	Capabilities: [80] Power Management version 3

Arguably this is not a legacy device (since this is a new server), but
in any case Xen needs to deal with it.
