This module allows you to use the GConf configuration system in order
to store/retrieve the configuration of an application. The GConf
system is a powerful configuration manager based on a user daemon that
handles a set of key and value pairs, and notifies any changes of the
value to every program that monitors those keys. GConf is used by
GNOME 2.x.
