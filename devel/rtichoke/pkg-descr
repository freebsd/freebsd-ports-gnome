rtichoke is an improved console for the R program with multiline editing and
rich syntax highlight and more...

Under the hood, rtichoke is built on top of the python library prompt-toolkit.
One would consider rtichoke as a ipython clone for R, though its layout and
keybinds are actually more similar to those of julia.

rtichoke is still under active developement, users should use it at their own
risks.
