Binary_search implements a generic binary search algorithm returning the
position of the first record whose index value is greater than or equal
to $val. The search routine does not define any of the terms position,
record or index value, but leaves their interpretation and
implementation to the user supplied function &$read(). The only
restriction is that positions must be integer scalars.
