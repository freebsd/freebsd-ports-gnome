The btest is a simple framework for writing unit tests. Freely
borrowing some ideas from other packages, it's main objective is to
provide an easy-to-use, straightforward driver for a suite of
shell-based tests. Each test consists of a set of command lines that
will be executed, and success is determined based on their exit
codes. btest comes with some additional tools that can be used
within such tests to compare output against a previously established
baseline.
