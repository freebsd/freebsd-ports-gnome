The ezpyinline is a pure python module which requires almost no setup to
allows you put C source code directly "inline" in a Python script or module,
then the C code is automatically compiled and then loaded for immediate access
from Python.

ezpyinline is forked from PyInline (http://pyinline.sourceforge.net/)
but aim to be as easy as possible and do all the magics for you.
