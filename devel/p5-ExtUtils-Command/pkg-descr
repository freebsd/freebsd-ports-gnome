ExtUtils::Command provides a number of utilities to replace common UNIX
commands in Makefiles, etc.  At present the list includes cp, rm_f,
rm_rf, mv, cat, eqtime, mkpath, touch, test_f, test_d, chmod, and
dos2unix.  Also included is the companion module Shell::Command, which
is a thin wrapper for ExtUtils::Command to provide cross-platform
functions emulating common shell commands.
