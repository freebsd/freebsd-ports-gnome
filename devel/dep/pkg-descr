Dep is a Go tool for managing vendor dependencies (not to be confused
with godep, a different, deprecated tool). dep updates the vendor/
directory contents based on a manifest, prunes unnecessary dependencies,
and adds missing dependencies to vendor/ as necessary.

dep is the heir-apparent for vendor management and is being actively
driven by the Go core team with an eye toward inclusion in the Go tool.
