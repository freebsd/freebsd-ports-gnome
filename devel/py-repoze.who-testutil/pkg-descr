repoze.who-testutil is a repoze.who plugin which modifies
repoze.who's original middleware to make it easier to forge
authentication, without bypassing identification (this is,
running the metadata providers).

It's been created to ease testing of repoze.who-powered
applications, in a way independent of the identifiers,
authenticators and challengers used originally by your
application, so that you won't have to update your test
suite as your application grows and the authentication
method changes.
