py-BytecodeAssembler is a simple bytecode assembler module that handles
most low-level bytecode generation details like jump offsets, stack size
tracking, line number table generation, constant and variable name index
tracking, etc. That way, you can focus your attention on the desired
semantics of your bytecode instead of on these mechanical issues.
