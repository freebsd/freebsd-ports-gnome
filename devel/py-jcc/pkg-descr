JCC is a C++ code generator for producing the glue code necessary to call
into Java classes from CPython via Java's Native Invocation Interface (JNI).

JCC generates C++ wrapper classes that hide all the gory details of JNI
access as well Java memory and object reference management.

JCC generates CPython types that make these C++ classes accessible from a
Python interpreter. JCC attempts to make these Python types pythonic by
detecting iterators and property accessors. Iterators and mappings may
also be declared to JCC.
