=head1 NAME

Canary::Stability - Stub to prevent checking perl compatibility for "schmorp" modules

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Canary::Stability;

=head1 PURPOSE

This is a stub module that neutralizes the original Canary::Stability
module. That module is a relic of a strange notion that "schmorp" should
prevent people from using any Perl released after 2015.
