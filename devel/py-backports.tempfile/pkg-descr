Yet another general purpose Naive Bayesian classifier.
(under heavy development)

Naive Bayes Classifier is probably the most widely used text classifier, 
it's a supervised learning algorithm. It can be used to classify blog posts
or news articles into different categories like sports, entertainment and
so forth. 

Naive Bayes is a simple technique for constructing classifiers: models that
assign class labels to problem instances, represented as vectors of feature
values, where the class labels are drawn from some finite set. It is not a
single algorithm for training such classifiers, but a family of algorithms
This package provides backports of new features in Python???s tempfile module
under the backports namespace.
