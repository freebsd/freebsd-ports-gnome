Lark can parse any context-free grammar, FAST and EASY!

For beginners, Lark is not just another parser. It can parse any grammar you
throw at it, no matter how complicated or ambiguous, and do so efficiently. It
also constructs a parse-tree for you, without additional code on your part.

For Experts, Lark lets you choose between Earley and LALR(1), to trade-off power
and speed. It also contains a CYK parser and unique features such as a
contextual-lexer.

Lark can:
- Parse all context-free grammars, and handle any ambiguity
- Build a parse-tree automagically, no construction code required
- Outperform all other Python libraries when using LALR(1) (Yes, including PLY)
- Run on every Python interpreter (it's pure-python)
- Generate a stand-alone parser (for LALR(1) grammars)
- And many more features. Read ahead and find out.

Most importantly, Lark will save you time and prevent you from getting parsing
headaches.
