These are a few data structures, classes and functions
which we've needed over many years of Python
programming and which seem to be of general use to
other Python programmers. Many of the modules that
have existed in pyutil over the years have subsequently
been obsoleted by new features added to the Python
language or its standard library, thus showing that
we're not alone in wanting tools like these.
