Tox is a decentralized, secure messenger with audio and video chat capabilities.
You can see it as an alternative to Skype.

This is only the core library. To use it, you have to install a client, like
e.g. net-im/toxic, net-im/qTox or net-im/uTox.

This legacy version must be used only with uTox (untill a new release).
