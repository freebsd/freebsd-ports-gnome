Share printers from your computer with ChromeOS and Android devices, using the
Cloud Print Connector. The Connector is a purpose-built system process. It can
share hundreds of printers on a powerful server, or one printer on a Raspberry
Pi.

For printing from CUPS clients to Google Cloud Print, please see
print/cups-cloud-print instead.
