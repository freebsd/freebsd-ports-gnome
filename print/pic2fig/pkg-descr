Pic2fig is a pic(l) preprocessor for drawing simple figures in Fig code.
The basic objects are box, line, arrow, circle, ellipse, arc and text.

When  pic2fig  is  executed, it produces an output file in the
current directory.  The name is constructed  from  the input  file's
name.  If the input filename ends with .pic, then that extension
will be replaced by .fig.   Otherwise, .fig  is appended to the input
filename.  If file does not exist, then pic2fig tries appending .pic
to the name.

Updated to produce FIG 3.2 format by Patrick Powell

Note:  this version does not support the groff/pic 'thickness' attribute.
