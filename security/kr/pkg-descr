kr enables SSH to authenticate with a key stored in a Krypton (iOS or
Android) mobile app. kr runs as an SSH agent, called krd. When a Krypton
private key operation is needed for authentication, krd routes this
request to the paired mobile phone, where the user decides whether to
allow the operation or not. The private key never leaves the phone.
