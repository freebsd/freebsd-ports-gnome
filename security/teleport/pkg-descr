What is Teleport?
=================
Gravitational Teleport ("Teleport") is a modern SSH server for remotely
accessing clusters of servers via SSH or HTTPS. It is intended to be used
instead of sshd. Teleport enables teams to easily adopt the best SSH practices
like:

Integrated SSH credentials with your organization Google Apps identities or
other OAuth identitiy providers. No need to distribute keys: Teleport uses
certificate-based access with automatic expiration time. Enforcement of 2nd
factor authentication. Cluster introspection: every Teleport node becomes a part
of a cluster and is visible on the Web UI. Record and replay SSH sessions for
knowledge sharing and auditing purposes. Collaboratively troubleshoot issues
through session sharing. Connect to clusters located behind firewalls without
direct Internet access via SSH bastions. Teleport is built on top of the
high-quality Golang SSH implementation and it is compatible with OpenSSH.
