Dependency-Check is a utility that attempts to detect publicly disclosed
vulnerabilities contained within project dependencies. It does this by
determining if there is a Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) identifier
for a given dependency. If found, it will generate a report linking to
the associated CVE entries.
