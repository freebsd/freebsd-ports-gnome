PBNJ is a network suite to monitor changes that occur on a network
over time. It does this by checking for changes on the target
machine(s), which includes the details about the services running on
them as well as the service state. PBNJ parses the data from a scan
and stores it in a database. PBNJ uses Nmap to perform scans.
