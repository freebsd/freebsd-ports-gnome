-will honor escape sequences in old_string and new_string.  Standard escapes such as "\t" (tab), "\n" (newline), "\r" (carriage return) are processed, as well as any octal or hexidecimal ASCII codes. Octal ASCII codes start with a '\' and are comprised of three digits [0-7] (e.g. '\015'). Hexidecimal ASCII codes start with '\0x' followed by two characters [0-f] (e.g. '\0x0d'). The 'x' and the [a-f] may be upper or lowercase. When you use this switch you must escape all backslash ('\') characters with another backslash (e.g. '\\').
