Survex is very powerful cave survey software, and is actively developing into
a complete cave visualisation package. It has a sophisticated GUI frontend.

Survex has no arbitrary limits, and so is particularly good for large
complicated cave systems, or areas where you need to see the relationships
between multiple cave systems. Putting existing data into it should be easy.
