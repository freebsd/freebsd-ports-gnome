YABT means Yet another Braille Translator.

YABT is a general purpose Braille translation system
written in pure python. It is primarily designed to
be used by the BrlTex Project, but due to its general
design it may be suited to use in other projects.

Currently YABT has a table for translation in to British
Braille encoded in ASCII Braille, but tables for other
codes and other output encodings such as unicode Braille
are possible.
