The Rumprun unikernel and toolchain for various platforms.

Rumprun works on not only on hypervisors such as KVM and Xen, but also on bare
metal. Rumprun can be used with or without a POSIX'y interface. The former
allows existing, unmodified POSIX applications to run out-of-the-box, while the
latter allows building highly customized solutions with minimal footprints.

The Rumprun unikernel supports applications written in, for example but not
limited to: C, C++, Erlang, Go, Java, Javascript (node.js), Python, Ruby and
Rust.
