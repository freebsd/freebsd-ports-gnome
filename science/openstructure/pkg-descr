This project aims to provide an open-source, modular, flexible, molecular
modelling and visualization environment.

Molecular structures are a central aspect of OpenStructure and a rich
understanding of macromolecular structure datasets with access to atoms,
residues, chains, bonds and torsions is offered.

Features:
* Intuitive representation of structural subsets, so-called EntityViews, that
  can be created with a dedicated query language or constructed manually for
  more complex cases.
* Real-time rendering of molecular structures
* Interactive Analysis of Trajectories
* Support for common file formats such as PDB, mmCIF, SDF, PQR
* Read more about molecular structures in OpenStructure
