TRIQS (Toolbox for Research on Interacting Quantum Systems) is a scientific
project providing a set of C++ and Python libraries to develop new tools for
the study of interacting quantum systems.

The goal of this toolkit is to provide high level, efficient and simple to use
libraries in C++ and Python, and to promote the use of modern programming
techniques.
