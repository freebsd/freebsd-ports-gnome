MOOSE is designed to simulate neural systems ranging from biochemical signaling
to complex models of single neurons, circuits, and large networks. A typical
use case is to model neural activity-driven synaptic plasticity, in which
network activity to synapses triggers biochemical reaction-diffusion events,
which in turn modulate ion channels to give rise to synaptic plasticity.
MOOSE can operate at many levels of detail, from stochastic chemical
computations, to multicompartment single-neuron models, to spiking neuron
network models.
