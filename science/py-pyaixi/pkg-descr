pyaixi is a pure Python implementation of the Monte Carlo-AIXI-Context Tree
Weighting (MC-AIXI-CTW) artificial intelligence algorithm.

This is an approximation of the AIXI universal artificial intelligence
algorithm, which describes a model-based, reinforcement-learning agent capable
of general learning.
