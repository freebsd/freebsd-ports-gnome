Lattice Microbes is a software package for efficiently sampling trajectories
from the chemical and reaction-diffusion master equations (CME/RDME) on high
performance computing (HPC) infrastructure using both exact and approximate
methods. pyLM is a problem solving environment written in Python that leverages
the high-performance nature of the Lattice Microbes package while providing ease
of use for common stochastic simulations and high customizability for complex
biological applications.
