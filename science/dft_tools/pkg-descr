TRIQS-based-based application is aimed at ab-initio calculations for correlated
materials, combining realistic DFT band-structure calculations with the
dynamical mean-field theory. Together with the necessary tools to perform the
DMFT self-consistency loop for realistic multi-band problems, the package
provides a full-fledged charge self-consistent interface to the Wien2K package.
In addition, if Wien2k is not available, it provides a generic interface for
one-shot DFT+DMFT calculations, where only the single-particle Hamiltonian in
orbital space has to be provided.
