If you are running FreeBSD 11.1 or older then in order to add st.info
to the terminal capability database it is required to

 * Install tic (included in devel/ncurses)
 * Run

   # tic -C -K -s -x %%DATADIR%%/st.info >> /usr/share/misc/termcap
   # cd /usr/share/misc
   # cap_mkdb termcap

Thanks to [1], this hack is not necessary on FreeBSD 11.2-RELEASE,
11-STABLE, and 12-CURRENT.
