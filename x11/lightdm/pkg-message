For LightDM to function, it requires one of the available greeters to be
installed, which are available in the ports tree at x11/lightdm-*greeter*

LightDM needs the maximum amount of memory a daemon may request to be locked
into main memory using mlock(2) to be increased above the FreeBSD default.
Without doing this, LightDM will often crash when the service is started.
To increase this limit, run the following commands:
# sed -i '' -e 's/memorylocked=128M/memorylocked=256M/' /etc/login.conf
# cap_mkdb /etc/login.conf
