BEMENU_RUN
When enabled the bundled bemenu-run utility will also be installed.
It behaves badly on FreeBSD with Wayland and might hang and not
release bemenu's key grab when executing a program.  It is recommended
to instead install x11/dmenu and use its dmenu_path script with
bemenu as a substitute.
