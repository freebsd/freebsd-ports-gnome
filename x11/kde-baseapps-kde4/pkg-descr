KDE Base Applications consists of what runs on the desktop. This
module isn't a complete collection of essential applications that a
user would expect on a desktop (such as e-mail and calculator). This
package is the basic set of applications beyond the workspace that KDE
applications can assume are installed. These applications should have
no problem running on Windows, OS X, Gnome, etc. as stand alone
applications if the user wanted to use them there.
