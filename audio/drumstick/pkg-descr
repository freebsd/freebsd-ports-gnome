Drumstick is a tool to play music. This is a set of C++ MIDI libraries using
Qt5 objects, idioms and style. It contains a C++ wrapper around software
support for MIDI. A complementary library provides classes for SMF
(Standard MIDI files: .MID/.KAR), Cakewalk (.WRK), and Overture (.OVE) file
formats processing. A multiplatform realtime MIDI I/O library is also provided.
