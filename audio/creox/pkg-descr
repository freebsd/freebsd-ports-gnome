Creox is a real-time sound processor. You can plug your electric guitar
or any other musical instrument directly to the PC's sound card and
start experimenting with various sound effects. Creox offers nice
user-friendly KDE-based GUI, a preset support, a low-latency DSP engine,
and each effect parameter can be altered "on the fly".

As Creox is a JACK application, the output sound can be routed to the
other JACK-aware applications, and the audio input can be taken as the
output from the other JACK client.
