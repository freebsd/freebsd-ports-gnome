Wammu Mobile Phone Manager

It works with any phone that Gammu supports, including many models from
Nokia, Siemens, and Alcatel. It has complete support (read, edit,
delete, copy) for contacts, todo, and calendar. It can read, save, and
send SMS. It includes an SMS composer for multi-part SMS messages, and
it can display SMS messages that include pictures. Currently, only text
and predefined bitmaps or sounds can be edited in the SMS composer. It
can export messages to an IMAP4 server (or other email storage).

This program does not support browsing files in phone.
