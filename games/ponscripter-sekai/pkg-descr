Ponscripter is an interpreter for visual-novel-type games, derived from
the NScripter design but modified significantly to improve support for
Western languages (at the cost of diminished support for Japanese).

Ponscripter is a fork of ONScripter-En that drops any attempt to remain
in synch with the upstream source code, and instead concentrates on
providing the best possible support for Western languages. It is no
longer fully NScripter-compatible, but remains an easy target to port
NScripter games to when localising them.

This fork takes advantage of SDL2 and improves Steam integration.
