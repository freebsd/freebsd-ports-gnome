Kajongg - the classical Mah Jongg for four players.  If you are
looking for the Mah Jongg solitaire please use the application
KMahjongg.

Kajongg can be used in two different ways.  Scoring a manual game
where you play as always and use Kajongg for the computation of
scores and for bookkeeping.  Or you can use Kajongg to play against
any combination of other human players or computer players.

Kajongg comes with a ruleset for classical Chinese as played in
Germany.  You can change the ruleset at your will and also define
whole new rulesets.  The rules for a game are saved in the database,
so every game could be played with different rules.  Changing a
ruleset does not affect existing games.
