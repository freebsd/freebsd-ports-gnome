The X-Plane Scenery Tools (XPTools) code base is the source code tree for all
of the Laminar Research scenery creation/editing tools.  This code does not
include X-Plane and the "X-Apps" (PlaneMaker, WorldMaker, AirfoilMaker, and
Briefer).  It does include source to the ac3d x-plane plugin, WED, the various
tools, and our global scenery generator.
