OpenDungeons is an open source, real time strategy game sharing game elements
with the Dungeon Keeper series and Evil Genius. Players build an underground
dungeon which is inhabited by creatures. Players fight each other for control
of the underground by indirectly commanding their creatures, directly casting
spells in combat, and luring enemies into sinister traps.
