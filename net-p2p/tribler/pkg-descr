Tribler is a social community that facilitates filesharing through a so called
peer-to-peer (p2p) network. A p2p network is structural different to a
server-computer structure, where every user downloads its files from one
central server. Within p2p the user/downloader becomes also an uploader to the
next user. In this way there is no central computer that provides every file
to all users.
