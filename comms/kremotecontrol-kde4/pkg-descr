KRemoteControl (formerly known as KDELirc) is a KDE frontend for
your remote controls. It allows to configure actions for button
presses on remotes. All types of remotes supported by the Solid
module in the KDE platform are also supported by KRemoteControl
(e.g. with the Linux Infrared Remote Control system (LIRC) as
backend).
