apib is a tool that makes it easy to test API servers.  It is supported
on Unix systems that include the Apache Portable Runtime and OpenSSL.

apib has most of the features of Apache Bench (ab), but is also intended
to be a more modern replacement.  In particular, it offers:

  - Proper HTTP 1.1 support including keep-alives and chunked encoding
  - Ability to spawn multiple I/O threads to take advantage of multiple
    CPU cores
  - Non-blocking I/O for high concurrency
  - Support for POST and PUT of large objects
  - Support for OAuth 1.0 signatures
  - Ability to output results to a file so they may be automated
  - Remote CPU monitoring
