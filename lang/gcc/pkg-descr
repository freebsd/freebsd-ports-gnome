GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection, supports a number of languages.  This
port installs the C, C++, Fortran and Java front ends as gcc5, g++5,
gfortran5, and gcj5, respectively.

It can be used (largely) interchangibly with the lang/gcc5 port, which
tracks GCC 5 releases, or the lang/gcc5-devel port, which tracks GCC 5
snapshots, and will move to GCC 6 and later over time.
