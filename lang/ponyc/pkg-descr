Pony is an object-oriented, actor-model, capabilities-secure programming
language. It's object-oriented because it has classes and objects, like
Python, Java, C++, and many other languages. It's actor-model because it has
actors (similar to Erlang or Akka). These behave like objects, but they can
also execute code asynchronously.
